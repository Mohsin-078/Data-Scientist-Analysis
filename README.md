 "𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬"



This project aimed to analyze the salaries of data scientist positions from 2020 to 2023, focusing on several key questions:

1. What are the top 5 highest-paying data scientist jobs?

2. In which countries are the companies employing data scientists primarily located?

3. What is the Minimum, Average and Maximum salary at each experience level?

4. Are there more remote employees compared to onsite employees?

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and imported into Microsoft Power BI for analysis. It comprises 𝟏𝟏 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧𝐬 and 𝟑,𝟕𝟓𝟓 𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬, providing a comprehensive overview of data scientist salaries across various parameters.

During the data processing phase, several issues were identified and addressed:

- 𝐀𝐛𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Some columns contained abbreviations for experience levels and company sizes. I researched these abbreviations and clarified them to enhance understanding.

- 𝐈𝐒𝐎 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬: The country names were represented using ISO codes, which made it challenging to identify the corresponding countries. I converted these codes to their full names for better clarity.

- 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: The dataset lacked headers, and the salaries column was not properly formatted. I added appropriate headers and ensured that the salary data was in a consistent format.

- 𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐓𝐢𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐬: The roles "ML Engineer" and "Machine Learning Engineer" were listed as separate titles, despite being identical. I standardized these entries for uniformity.

Once the data was cleaned, I imported it into Power BI to gain deeper insights and create visualizations. The analysis revealed the following key findings:

- The majority of companies employing data scientists are located in the USA, which has a total of 𝟑,𝟎𝟒𝟎 companies, followed by Great Britain and Canada.

- In terms of work arrangements, 𝟓𝟏.𝟐𝟏% of employees work onsite, while 𝟒𝟑.𝟕𝟓% are remote. Hybrid roles make up 𝟓.𝟎𝟑% of the total workforce.

This project not only provided valuable insights into the salary landscape for data scientists but also enhanced my skills in data processing and visualization using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.
